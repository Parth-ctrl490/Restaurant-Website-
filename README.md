-CSS (643 lines):--- I aimed to develop a cohesive and visually engaging design that reflects the restaurant's brand and atmosphere. I utilized:
Flexbox and Grid:- or a responsive layout, ensuring it adapts to various screen sizes while maintaining the original design aesthetic.
Custom animations:- for hover effects on buttons, images, and navigation elements, creating a lively feel that encourages user interaction.
Consistent styling:- across color schemes, typography, and spacing to enhance the user experience, making it both intuitive and appealing.

HTML (256 lines):--- I structured the site for simplicity and functionality. My main objectives were:
Semantic HTML:- Providing a clear structure for search engines and screen readers, which improves accessibility and SEO.
Modular content sections:- Organizing the restaurant’s information into logical parts—Home, Menu, About Us, and Contact—to guide users smoothly.

JavaScript (44 lines):--- I incorporated light interactivity to enhance the site without overwhelming users, including:
Smooth scrolling effects:- for a seamless experience when navigating between sections.
Dynamic content display:- with simple event listeners for interactive menu items and contact forms, ensuring quick and fluid responses.
